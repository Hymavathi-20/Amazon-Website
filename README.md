# Amazon-Website
- The project is a small draft of the Amazon website created using only HTML to apply HTML concepts learned.  
- It includes basic elements like a navigation bar, product listings, and footer, forming the structure of the homepage.  
- The goal is to enhance the project by adding CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactivity, and other web technologies for improved design and functionality.
